RohitThakur,"note: My suggestion is in the attachment, brief provided in the comment here. We have always been fascinated by the crystal clear water and the cleanliness we observe in the international beach destinations. People have associated popular beaches in India to be dirty and not up to the mark. However, I think by implementing certain policies and methodologies we can be better or atleast near to the cleanliness of international tourist destinations. The littering activities not only spoil the look of the beach but are also dangerous to the flora and fauna. I have prepared a simple beach cleaning framework to address at high level. (P.S., Could not put the whole content due to word limitation in the comment itself). As part of the framework, it offers some steps to tackle the problem. ",19-09-2022 15:18,"note: My suggestion is in the attachment, brief provided in the comment here.

Inderpal Kaur,"Over the last few decades, plastic has become an essential part of our everyday lives. From grocery bags to toys and bottles, plastic is one of the most used materials to date. However, this material is unfortunately causing a great deal of harm to ocean life too.By 2050, it is predicted that we will have more plastic in our oceans than fish. While this problem isn’t going away any time soon, scientists have been working to create solutions that can slowly start to clean up our oceans and put an end to this major issue. Here are just some of the techniques being used.Switch to plastic-free alternativesConsider eliminating your use of single-use plastic and adopting eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives. Simple things like using reusable grocery bags, glass coffee cups and reusable straws can make a difference long-term. It’s important to note that while these small changes can reduce plastic waste, these alternatives also carry their own footprint.Avoid ocean-harming productsWhil",19-09-2022 15:18,"Over the last few decades, plastic has become an essential part of our everyday lives.

Jitto James,The municipality or the agencies should not collect money for waste disposal from the public but the government should form a company exclusively for waste collection and disposal. Every product sold through shops or supermarkets should collect a cess which should go to the waste disposal company. Government should acquire a bigger estate or use an Island in the sea for building high-tech waste disposal facilities because the construction of any waste disposal company in a densely populated area will invite public anger. There should be a toll-free number and a call center for the public to inform about any garbage collection and failure of the facilities provided by the new company. Until we successfully implement the project all the existing facilities and their funding should not be stopped.

Mohit Arya,"Beaches are dirty because of non-biodegradable material, 90% of which is plastic, being discarded by the people living along or near the coastline. Today Oceans and seas are saddled with huge amount of plastic which is a cause of concern in many countries. My proposal is to use this plastic to make plastic bricks or ecobricks which can be used to make low cost, little load bearing structures like boundary walls, shelters, railings, benches etc. This way we will not only be able to clean the beaches but will be able to dispose this plastic waste in a better way, instead of shifting from sea to land. For the purpose, NGOs can be employed who buy these ecobricks from ragpickers and use them for making non-load bearing structures. This will also give a source of income to ragpickers.",19-09-2022 15:18,"Beaches are dirty because of non-biodegradable material, 90% of which is plastic, being discarded by the people living along or near the coastline.

We will grow up to responsible citizens who will never dump plastic waste on the beaches. My second point is, posters that say dumping plastic is banned on the beach can be put up. How plastic harm the beaches and marine creatures can also be written on the posters. This way they will realise the the consequences of their actions. People can also be charged for dumping plastic.

Second, the vendors should be made to understand the importance of cleaninness ans they should tell theier customers not to throw anything outside dustbin.

For this, every industrial unit should set up a contaminated water treatment plant for proper treatment of industrial contaminated water. Also, proper treatment of domestic contaminated water coming out of urban bodies is also required. Till treatment is not ensured at the source of contaminated water, the problem of pollution cannot be controlled. Along with industrial and domestic contaminated water, separation of other wastes brought through rivers is also necessary before getting into the sea.

HARISH HIHOR,"सभी नदियाँ अन्ततः समुद्रों में मिलती हैं। समुद्री प्रदूषण का प्रमुख कारण इन नदियों के द्वारा बहाकर लाया गया दूषित जल एवं अपशिष्ट है। नदियों के माध्यम से औद्योगिक निस्राव के साथ घरेलू दूषित जल बड़ी मात्रा में समुद्रों में मिलता है। अतः स्पष्ट है कि समुद्रों में मिलने से पहले यदि नदी के दूषित जल को स्वच्छ कर लिया जाये तो समुद्रों में होने वाले प्रदूषण को कम किया जा सकता है। इस हेतु औद्योगिक दूषित जल को समुचित उपचार के लिये प्रत्येक औद्योगिक इकाई को दूषित जल उपचार संयंत्र लगाना चाहिए। साथ ही नगरीय निकायों से निकलने वाले घरेलू दूषित जल का भी उचित उपचार किया जाना आवश्यक है। जब तक दूषित जल का स्रोत पर ही उपचार सुनिश्चित नहीं होगा, तब तक प्रदूषण की समस्या पर नियंत्रण नहीं किया जा सकता। औद्योगिक एवं घरेलू दूषित जल के साथ ही नदियों के माध्यम से बहाकर लाये जाने वाले अन्य अपशिष्टों का भी समुद्र में मिलने से पूर्व पृथक्करण आवश्यक है। समुद्री गतिविधियों पर नजर रखकर भी समुद्री प्रदूषण को नियंत्रित किया जा सकता है। यथासम्भव, समुद्रों में तेल आदि के रिसाव को रोकना चाहिए।",19-09-2022 15:18,"All rivers are finally found in the seas.

For this, every industrial unit should set up a contaminated water treatment plant for proper treatment of industrial contaminated water. Also, proper treatment of domestic contaminated water coming out of urban bodies is also required. Till treatment is not ensured at the source of contaminated water, the problem of pollution cannot be controlled. Along with industrial and domestic contaminated water, separation of other wastes brought through rivers is also necessary before getting into the sea.

One innovative solution can be to lease out beach area to event management companies for organising sporting tournaments like volleyball and beach cricket. The revenue generated through these events can be utilised for beach cleaning. Moreover, the organizing committees should be advised to strictly follow zero waste policy. Second solution is to incentivise fishermen and vendors at beaches to keep the beach clean. With the continuous sea breeze at beaches, light weighing waste particles often get scattered which makes the job of municipality cleaners very difficult but the fishermen and local sea-vendors are present at beaches almost throughout the day which makes them reliable for task.

Farvez Basha D,"The concept of environmental sustainability is about the natural environment and how it remains productive and resilient to support human life. Environmental sustainability relates to ecosystem integrity and carrying capacity of natural environment (Brodhag & Taliere, 2006).

I am not sure if this is the right platform to put my views on how we could minimize mindless usage of plastics. A major reason for this is significantly low cost of plastics 1) Various types of plastic materials are derived from limited number of raw materials, hence if government would be able to gain monopoly over the plastic raw materials/precursors then it would be possible that the prices for these raw materials be increased to 5-10 folds. As it is said necessity is the mother of all inventions, people would then be forced to look for biodegradable alternatives and think twice before carelessly buying a bottle of drinking water. 2) The MRP of bottled drinking water/juices must be increased by three fold 3) Supply of bottled drinking water at functions and gatherings must be banned and fined",19-09-2022 15:18,"Majority of the waste that gets dumped along the beach and coast line account to plastic and effective ways to manage and plastic waste needs to be brought in place.

For example: when our car tyres gets burst in between our journey, we simply attach a Tyre tube with another car and tow our car simply up-to mechanic workshop similarly, we can connect a medium tub or some carrier behind it. As in attached you tube video we can see Afroz shah sir is cleaning waste with primary method which takes a lot of time to clean a wide beach. But on other hand if we use this carrier method we can reduce our time and hard work. So, with this thank you and if anyone interested member have any idea or wants to add something then please reply below to make people aware about this idea.",19-09-2022 15:19,"Hello all and namaste, today I came here with a new idea.

Sahana Vinod,"Respected Mr. Prime Minister It is quite true that beaches, since they are neglected and taken for granted, are now filled with all kinds of garbage. Ensuring that the beaches are cleaned and maintaining them is going to take tons of work, considering the country's vast coastline. My suggestion is that while the regulations such as bringing reusable bags, not littering, etc. are in the process of implementation (as it is being discussed by others in this forum), people can also be employed in cleaning these areas for the time being. I suggest this because imposing rules is a long process and in the meantime the beaches may become yet more polluted. People who are already working need not be employed by some campaign, programme, etc. There are many poor beggars in our country who try to get employed.
